# es-en-translation

This is an Spanish-to-English translation model that I built in PyTorch. It use the standard Transformer architecture with an Encoder and Decoder. See the code in model.py and Jupyter Notebook for more details. The model takes in a sequence of spanish words, and outputs the english translation (up to 50 words).
